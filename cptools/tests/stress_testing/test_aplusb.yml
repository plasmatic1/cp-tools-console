# YAML Node info:
# - gen: Generator program, used to generate input (and also, output)
# - slow: Reference (slow) solution, used to generate output
# - fast: The solution to test (fast) solution
#
# By default, the case input is generated using the STDOUT of the generator, and the output is generated from the
# STDOUT of the reference solution after given the case input as the input.  However, if the slow node is not specified,
# the output is instead the STDERR of the generator process (note that this also means a non-empty STDERR won't be treated
# as an RTE verdict (non-zero exit code will still trigger an RTE verdict)).
#
# Additionally, the case number will be passed as ARGV[1] to both the gen and slow processes when they're run.  This
# can be used to seed the RNG of those processes.

# Checker used to check solution
checker: tokens

# Executors
# This node is optional.  The default executor for the file extension will be used if not specified
executors:
  gen: py
  fast: py

# Source files
gen: generate.py
fast: aplusb.py
